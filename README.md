## NGO Organization Description
Wikimedia Foundation:

Who hasn’t used Wikipedia at least once in their life? This and many other projects of informative nature make The Wikimedia Foundation a unique sort of international NGO. One that believes in information’s importance rather than the profits that can be generated by selling it.
